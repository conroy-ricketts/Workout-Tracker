# Workout Tracker App
A cross-platform mobile app that tracks and personalizes optimal workout plans!

## Inspiration
Our team believes that health and well-being is very important for college students today, and we have yet to see an intuitive app that generates a personalized workout plan with an eye-catching, easy-to-understand workout tracker.

This project is a submission to the Knight Hacks projects program at the University of Central Florida.

## What it does
Using our mobile app, users are able to get a a personalized workout plan based on a survey of workout goals and desired physique. Once the perfect workout plan is given, the user may use the app to track workouts in an intuitive, easy-to-use interface.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We developed a fully functional full-stack mobile app!

## How we built it
### We decided to utilize the following languages and technologies:
#### Frontend:
- React Native
- TypeScript (and JavaScript)
- Expo

#### Backend:
- MongoDB
- TypeScript (and JavaScript)

#### Other tools:
- Visual Studio Code
- Android Studio
- Xcode
- Node.js

## Challenges we ran into
- Project scope. We were ambitous with our ideas for this project, and due to that we found ourselves not able to finish everything we envisioned. So, we got together as a team and made ciritical, thoughtful design decisions in order to determine what was absolutely necessary for both our minimal viable product and the end-user experience.

## What we learned
- New tools and technologies. Most of our team was new to the tools and technologies that we used in the implementation of our app. So, this project was a great oppurtinity to broaden our skill sets, especially when it comes to React Native and TypeScript!
- Teamwork. Each of our skills in working with a team were undoubtedly improved by us collaborating on this project. We had to learn to make compromises with each other, actively listen to each other's ideas, and strategize how to effectively design and implement our app.
- Communication skills. This goes hand-and-hand with teamwork. In order to explain our ideas and visions for our project amongst ourselves, we definitely needed to improve our communication skills. Or project would be dead-in-the-water without that.

## What's next for Workout Tracker
- We want to flesh out all of the other ideas that we had for our app but were unable to finish within the Kinght Hacks project daadline. These other ideas include: user accounts, user login, profile pictures, app themes, and exercise demonstration screens.
